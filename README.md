# Censoring Simulation Pipeline

This repository contains the code used to generate semi-synthetic censoring in real-world survival datasets.  
The simulation reproduces different censoring rates while preserving realistic time distributions using an iterative probability correction method.  
It also includes a synthetic data generation module for studying the dependency between event times (T) and censoring times (C).

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `simulate_censoring_pipeline.py`: Core module containing all functions for simulating censoring.  
- `synthetic_generation.py`: Generates synthetic datasets with controllable dependency between event and censoring times.  
- `main.py`: Entry point that loads datasets, applies the simulation, and optionally generates synthetic data.  
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.  
- `data/`: Folder containing preprocessed survival datasets in CSV format.  
- `results/`: Output folder where simulated datasets will be stored (automatically created).

## Setup Instructions

1. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the simulation pipeline:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will:
- Load the preprocessed CSV datasets from the `data/` folder
- Simulate censoring at different rates (e.g. 10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 90%)
- Save the generated datasets in corresponding subfolders under `results/`
- (Optional) Generate six synthetic datasets under data/synthetic/ for dependency analysis between event and censoring times.


- All datasets in `data/` are already preprocessed and ready to use.
- You can modify the list of censoring rates and number of replications directly in `main.py`.
- Each generated file includes a `true_time` column preserving the original event time.
- Synthetic datasets include full $(T, C, Y, \delta)$ vectors to allow studying dependency preservation.
